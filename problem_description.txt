Problem Description:

Imagine you are tasked with building a simple RESTful API for managing a library system. The API
should interact with a database to perform basic CRUD operations on books. Implement three API
endpoints with increasing complexity:

1. Endpoint 1: Retrieve All Books
Implement an endpoint that retrieves a list of all books in the library from the database.
Endpoint: GET /api/books
Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct retrieval of all books from the database.
- Proper error handling for database connection issues.

2. Endpoint 2: Add a New Book
Implement an endpoint that allows the addition of a new book to the library.
Endpoint: POST /api/books
Request Body: JSON object representing the new book.
Evaluation Criteria:
- Proper validation of the request payload.
- Correct insertion of the new book into the database.
- Appropriate handling of errors, such as duplicate book entries.

3. Endpoint 3: Update Book Details
Implement an endpoint that allows updating the details of a specific book in the library.
Endpoint: PUT /api/books/{id}
Request Body: JSON object with updated book details.
Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct identification and retrieval of the book from the database.
- Proper validation of the request payload.
- Updating the book details in the database.
- Handling errors, such as updating a non-existent book.

Candidates are encouraged to provide a read me on how to run the application, also with a method
to seed the database with mock data. Also include clear documentation for APIs in the read me,
including endpoint descriptions, expected request/response formats, and any additional information
that aids understanding and usage of the API.
